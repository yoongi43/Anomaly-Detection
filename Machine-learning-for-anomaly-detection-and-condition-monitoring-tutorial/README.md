## Requirement


### Data
Downloaded from https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/

From above page, download 4th dataset : Bearing Data Set

Files are unzipped and saved at './data'

"4th_test" dataset of Bearing Data Set has another 'txt' folder in the path. All the files should be out of txt folder and put in '4th_text' folder
